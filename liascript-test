**DITAP Introduction**

Welcome to the Digital IT Acquisition Professional Training & Development Open Source Content Space.

##Team Collaboration##
During orientation, you will meet and begin working with your Live Digital Assignment team. One of the first things you will do as a team is draft a team charter.

###Team Charter###
A team charter is a written statement of your team's objectives and operating principles. It is a living contract, so while contract changes will occur as the team learns how to function as a single unit, each team member is accountable to all of the items outlined within it. Because it is a living document, plan to review the charter on a regular basis so revisions can be made. Finally, everyone on the team is responsible to help write the charter. This means that everyone's ideas and opinions should be included in the contract, and it should not be written by one person and passed around to the rest of the team.

While you will be provided with a worksheet for your team charter, you can access a blank copy of the document here.

###User Manual###
Prior to Orientation, you will need to complete this short user manual for yourself. The user manual includes 7 self-reflective questions that will enable your team to get to know you and work more effectively with you. Please complete this manual and bring it with you to orientation.
