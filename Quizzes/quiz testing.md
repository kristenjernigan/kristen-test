2\. Scenario-Based Multiple Choice

**Scenario:**  
You're working with a team in your agency that is planning for government/end user reviews of a software product. The team has traditionally held 2–3 day sessions after six months of development to collect feedback all at once. You want to explore whether a more iterative approach would be better, given the difficulty of gathering users for long reviews and the benefits of earlier feedback.

You have a good working relationship with the team lead. She responds to your suggestion by saying:

>*“I really appreciate all you’re doing to transform how we do business around here, but we don’t have time or money to break up our reviews and hold them more iteratively. We only have a year period of performance, and our budget is tight! I know what the Agile Manifesto says about the importance of customer collaboration—and we’re doing it! But we’re also adapting it to the realities of the government and our agency.”*

**How should you respond?**

- [[x]] “Can you talk me through your past experiences with the 2-3 day sessions and how they’ve been used to gather customer feedback? What has worked well? What hasn’t?”  
- [[ ]] “I have a great case study from another agency about how they implemented this approach and mitigated risk. It really can work in government!”  
- [[ ]] “I understand where you’re coming from. It doesn’t sound like this is the time to try something different, but please keep it in mind for future efforts.”  
[[?]] This response invites collaboration and reflection without being confrontational. It acknowledges the team’s experience and opens a productive dialogue.

- [[ ]] Use a waterfall process to define every requirement up front
- [[x]] Use Agile to deliver value in stages while gathering feedback
- [[ ]] Purchase a commercial off-the-shelf solution without further research
[[?]] Since the project scope is evolving, Agile is best for delivering in stages while gathering input.

Question 2

**You’re managing a software development contract with multiple vendor teams. Which Agile practice will help ensure visibility into progress and performance?**

- [[ ]]  Require weekly email updates  
- [[x]] Schedule a sprint review every 2 weeks  
- [[ ]] Wait for the final product demo
[[?]] Email updates and final demos don’t offer the same transparency and collaboration as sprint reviews.

Question 3

**Which of the following best describes a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)?**

- [[ ]] The final, fully-featured product
- [[ ]] A product prototype used only for internal 
- [[x]] A basic version with essential features to test value quickly
[[?]] MVPs aren’t prototypes or final products—they’re a smart way to test value early.

Question 4

**Which role primarily manages the product backlog and prioritizes user needs?**

- [[ ]] Scrum Master   
- [[x]] Product Owner     
- [[ ]] Developer
