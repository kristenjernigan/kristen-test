# Quiz Testing

| Situation | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **1. Who is my customer?** | You’re working on a digital services procurement and need to answer the question, “Who is my customer?” That’s easy, you think — it’s the program office or the program owner, the visionary and champion for the product or service. But wait a minute. Is that always the case? Are they the end users who will use the product or service? For instance, are they the individual entering data into a system, the citizen using your website to learn about energy-efficient products, or the government team that will primarily use this new tool? The answer to this question will drive how you approach the acquisition. End users should drive your technical and design decisions, so get them involved in the process! This sounds simple in theory. However, it’s not so simple in execution, when you have other stakeholders—budget, acquisition policy, CIO/IT, as well as vendors and contractors—who feel strongly about the design and execution of the product or service. |
| **2. The late stakeholder** | You’ve spent months putting together an acquisition plan and getting various stakeholders to review and provide feedback along the way. All of a sudden, a new stakeholder—one you hadn’t thought to include to date—provides feedback that requires you to significantly adjust your approach. Frustrated, you think, “If only I had thought to get them on board and involved earlier on, we could’ve had a better product and saved time and money.” We can probably all relate to a time (or times!) when this has happened and the resulting frustration we felt. |




Question 1

**Your agency needs to replace an outdated legacy system, causing usability issues for staff and the public. The scope isn’t fully defined yet, and stakeholder needs are still being explored. What’s the best approach?**

- [[ ]] Use a waterfall process to define every requirement up front
- [[x]] Use Agile to deliver value in stages while gathering feedback
- [[ ]] Purchase a commercial off-the-shelf solution without further research
[[?]] Since the project scope is evolving, Agile is best for delivering in stages while gathering input.

Question 2

**You’re managing a software development contract with multiple vendor teams. Which Agile practice will help ensure visibility into progress and performance?**

- [[ ]]  Require weekly email updates  
- [[x]] Schedule a sprint review every 2 weeks  
- [[ ]] Wait for the final product demo
[[?]] Email updates and final demos don’t offer the same transparency and collaboration as sprint reviews.

Question 3

**Which of the following best describes a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)?**

- [[ ]] The final, fully-featured product
- [[ ]] A product prototype used only for internal 
- [[x]] A basic version with essential features to test value quickly
[[?]] MVPs aren’t prototypes or final products—they’re a smart way to test value early.

Question 4

**Which role primarily manages the product backlog and prioritizes user needs?**

- [[ ]] Scrum Master   
- [[x]] Product Owner     
- [[ ]] Developer
[[?]] While Scrum Masters support team flow, the Product Owner sets priorities and gathers requirements.


1. There is no WiFi where I am. That means I cannot access any digital services.
- [[ ]] True
- [[X]] False
[[?]] Digital services can be deployed on a mobile phone using your data plan.



2. It sounds like only adults can be end users of digital services since it's for finding important information or filling out forms. 
- [[ ]] True
- [[X]] False
[[?]] As a grade-school student, you could access a teacher’s webpage to find homework for that day. That’s a digital service! You might also use websites like Study Island or Khan Academy. These are digital services as well. You’re able to access information and complete “transactions” in a digital manner.
