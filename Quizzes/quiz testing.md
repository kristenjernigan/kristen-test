# Quiz Testing

1. Which of the following best describes the purpose of identifying constraints before developing an acquisition strategy?

- [[ ]] To eliminate any need for market research  
- [[ ]] To make the process longer but more detailed  
- [[x]] To understand boundaries that inform realistic, aligned strategies  
- [[ ]] To determine vendor preferences before writing the solicitation
[[?]] Identifying constraints helps teams stay aligned with practical boundaries and craft realistic strategies.

2. True or False? Constraints should only be identified for high-risk or large-scale procurements.

- [[x]] False
- [[ ]] True
[[?]] Constraints should be identified for all acquisition efforts, regardless of size, because they guide sound strategy development.

3. Which of the following are constraints that could impact your strategy? *(Select all that apply.)*

- [[ ]] Vendor past performance ratings  
- [[x]] Length of contractor onboarding  
- [[x]] Type and timing of available funding  
- [[x]] Required security authorizations (e.g., ATO)  
- [[ ]] Number of vendors on the GSA Schedule
[[?]] Constraints often involve time, funding, approvals, and readiness factors—not just vendor history.

4. Why is treating constraint discovery like a checklist instead of a conversation risky?

- [[ ]] It wastes too much time  
- [[ ]] It makes it harder to meet compliance rules  
- [[x]] It misses the trust- and alignment-building benefits of team discussion  
- [[ ]] It only works if legal is in the room
[[?]] Collaborative conversations surface practical insights and build alignment across stakeholders.

5. Scenario

You’re planning a new digital services procurement. During early discovery, you learn that:
- Your COR has limited availability  
- Contractor onboarding takes 60–90 days  
- There’s a possibility of reengineering outdated business processes

What should you do? (Choose the BEST option)

- [[ ]] Ignore these constraints—they’ll sort themselves out during evaluation.  
- [[ ]] Choose a firm-fixed-price contract now and adjust if needed.
- [[x]] Build in a phased approach, include delivery support services, and engage leadership on process flexibility.  
- [[ ]] Push back the solicitation until these constraints are no longer relevant.
[[?]] A phased, proactive approach reduces risk and supports agility as constraints are addressed over time.

6. Which of the following benefits come from defining constraints early? *(Select all that apply.)*

- [[x]] Ability to shape a realistic, achievable strategy  
- [[x]] Avoid mid-process surprises or delays  
- [[ ]] Ensure you award to the lowest bidder  
- [[x]] Support more defensible, mission-aligned decisions  
- [[x]] Strengthen relationships with policy, legal, and IT teams
[[?]] Early constraint discovery builds stronger strategies and relationships—critical for digital service acquisitions.




Question 1

**Your agency needs to replace an outdated legacy system, causing usability issues for staff and the public. The scope isn’t fully defined yet, and stakeholder needs are still being explored. What’s the best approach?**

- [[ ]] Use a waterfall process to define every requirement up front
- [[x]] Use Agile to deliver value in stages while gathering feedback
- [[ ]] Purchase a commercial off-the-shelf solution without further research
[[?]] Since the project scope is evolving, Agile is best for delivering in stages while gathering input.

Question 2

**You’re managing a software development contract with multiple vendor teams. Which Agile practice will help ensure visibility into progress and performance?**

- [[ ]]  Require weekly email updates  
- [[x]] Schedule a sprint review every 2 weeks  
- [[ ]] Wait for the final product demo
[[?]] Email updates and final demos don’t offer the same transparency and collaboration as sprint reviews.

Question 3

**Which of the following best describes a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)?**

- [[ ]] The final, fully-featured product
- [[ ]] A product prototype used only for internal 
- [[x]] A basic version with essential features to test value quickly
[[?]] MVPs aren’t prototypes or final products—they’re a smart way to test value early.

Question 4

**Which role primarily manages the product backlog and prioritizes user needs?**

- [[ ]] Scrum Master   
- [[x]] Product Owner     
- [[ ]] Developer
[[?]] While Scrum Masters support team flow, the Product Owner sets priorities and gathers requirements.


1. There is no WiFi where I am. That means I cannot access any digital services.
- [[ ]] True
- [[X]] False
[[?]] Digital services can be deployed on a mobile phone using your data plan.



2. It sounds like only adults can be end users of digital services since it's for finding important information or filling out forms. 
- [[ ]] True
- [[X]] False
[[?]] As a grade-school student, you could access a teacher’s webpage to find homework for that day. That’s a digital service! You might also use websites like Study Island or Khan Academy. These are digital services as well. You’re able to access information and complete “transactions” in a digital manner.
